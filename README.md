# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of the Bikesharing statistical analysis is to convince investors that a bikesharing program in Des Moines will be a good business proposal. This is done by presenting this analysis using Tableau and Pandas to change the time from an integer to a datetime datatype. The dataframe is shown  below:

This dataframe provides the columns showing the tripduration changed to a datetime datatype and allows the calculation from start time to end time to be used in the trip analysis. 
 
## Results
The following visualizations show the bikesharing analysis needed to show how a bikesharing program can benefit the city of Des Moines as it has for New York City. 

### Tableua Story 

- Checkout Times for Users shows the trip durations for bike users, which the majority are less than an hour.

## Summary 
The visualizations show the bikesharing program is very popular in August in NYC, mostly the Manhattan area. Since the majority of the population in this area walk, it makes sense that bikesharing would be a huge success. Bikesharing is cheaper and a faster commute than walking. 

It can also be assumed that bikesharing is used for deliveries in congested areas and commutes to and from work, but also for exercise and keeping active. 

### Future Analysis
Additional visualizations can be used to show how effective bikesharing is year round. If bikesharing is used year round for commuting back and forth to work or for deliveries, this can still be a great program to establish in Des Moines. 
  - A visualization showing all age groups can be helpful to know what age groups to target in advertisements. 
  - A visualization showing the cost comparison between bikesharing and other transportation options can be a benefit as well.
